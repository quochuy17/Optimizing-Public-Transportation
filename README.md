# Optimizing-Public-Transportation
### In this project, you will construct a streaming event pipeline around Apache Kafka and its ecosystem. Using public data from the Chicago Transit Authority we will construct an event pipeline around Kafka that allows us to simulate and display the status of train lines in real time.

### When the project is complete, you will be able to monitor a website to watch trains move from station to station.
### Prerequisites
- To complete your project locally, the following are required:
  + Docker
  + Python 3.7
  + A minimum of 16gb+ RAM and a 4-core CPU on your computer to execute the simulation
  
### Directory Layout
- The project consists of two main directories, producers and consumers.
  + The following directory layout indicates with a * the files that the student is responsible for modifying. Instructions for what is required are present as comments in each file.
